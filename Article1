How to effectively manage third party vendor risk assessment….

What are vendors?
Consider, we have a business/organization the work in this would comprise of many things that a singular department could handle. This would consist of processing paychecks, ensuring data security, customer support and numerous other tasks. Given the complexity of this,it is normal for companies to rely on third-party vendors.
Nonetheless, with this approach, it is not exceptional for organizations to face tribulations, making it very crucial to apply security approach before any adversity.
Why are third party vendor a risk factor?
Third party vendors even though not directly integrated to an organization, in order to work efficiently need their hands on crucial company data that might include personal details of a customer, company, sensitive financial data that could include
Personal and Sensitive Customer Data:
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.
Customer profiles, contact details, and user activity data (e.g., browsing behavior, purchase history).

Financial Information:
Transaction records, payment details, and bank account information are critical data that vendors may need to access, particularly in sectors such as finance, e-commerce, and payroll services.

Operational and Business Data:
Data related to internal operations, including strategic plans, vendor contracts, and sensitive communications that could expose vulnerabilities.

Case Study of vendor risk
Uber Data Breach (2022) :
Overview: In December 2022, Uber suffered a data breach caused by a third-party vendor, Teqtivity. Teqtivity is a company that helps Uber track and manage its IT assets, like computers and devices. Hackers broke into Teqtivity's system, which allowed them to access Uber's internal network and steal sensitive employee information.
How the Attack Happened:
Hacked Vendor: Hackers first broke into Teqtivity's systems. Since Teqtivity had access to Uber's network, this gave the hackers a way to get into Uber's systems too.
Stolen Data: The hackers stole email addresses and other personal information of over 77,000 Uber employees, including both current and past employees.
Exploiting Vendor Access: This breach shows how hackers can take advantage of compromised vendor access to get into a company's internal systems and steal sensitive data.

Impact of the Breach:
Employee Data Exposure: The breach exposed personal information of many Uber employees, which could lead to problems like identity theft or phishing attacks.
Reputation Damage: Uber's reputation took a hit because it relied on a third-party vendor that was compromised. People began to question how safe Uber's data really was.
Regulatory Attention: After the breach, Uber probably faced more scrutiny from regulators, who would want to ensure the company was doing enough to protect sensitive data and secure its third-party relationships.

Strategies and steps to manage vendor risk effectively 
Conduct Thorough Vendor Assessments: Before engaging with a vendor, assess their security practices, financial stability, and reputation. Ensure they meet your company's risk management standards and can protect sensitive data.
Establish Clear Contracts and SLAs: Create detailed contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) outlining security requirements, data protection measures, and vendor responsibilities. This ensures that both parties understand their roles and expectations.
Implement Strong Access Controls: Limit the data and systems that vendors can access. Use the principle of least privilege, meaning vendors should only have access to the information necessary for them to perform their tasks.
Monitor Vendor Performance Regularly: Continuously monitor vendor activities and their compliance with security protocols. Conduct regular audits, security checks, and performance reviews to ensure they meet agreed-upon standards.
Establish a Contingency Plan: Have a backup plan in case a vendor fails or breaches security. This includes identifying alternative vendors, ensuring data recovery processes are in place, and having a clear action plan for managing disruptions.
